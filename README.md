Opencaching.de Code Repository
==============================

[Opencaching.de](http://www.opencaching.de) is a major Geocaching website in Germany.
This repository contains the website's code, including all third-party libraries
needed to run it. It is one of two major Opencaching code forks; the other one is
[Opencaching.pl](http://code.google.com/p/opencaching-pl/).

Feel free to use it under the provided
[license terms](https://github.com/OpencachingDeutschland/oc-server3/blob/master/doc/license.txt)
for setting up your own open and free Geocaching listing service! Your contributions
to this project are welcome - you may contact the team in the
[Opencaching network forum](http://forum.opencaching-network.org/) if you like to
join us. Development is done on a VirtualBox Linux system that you can run on your
Linux, Windows or Mac workstation.

This repo contains three major branches:
* the *stable* branch with current Opencaching.de production code
* the *master* branch, basis of all development, which contains code that will be released with the next site update
* the *next* branch with experimental features to be tested.

The *next* branch is now and then hard-resetted to the master branch and rebuilt from there,
so do not derive any working-branches from it. Use master instead.

Major OC.de site updates are version-tagged. See the [changelog](http://www.opencaching.de/articles.php?page=changelog&locale=EN)
for a detailed list.
