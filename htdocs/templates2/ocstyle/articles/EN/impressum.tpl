<p><b>What is a "geocache" in our terms?</b></p>
<p>A geocache is a hidden container with a logbook, which has to be found by geographical coordinates. As proof of finding, the finder writes a record in the logbook. Alternatively, there may be no container, but the user will have to visit the location, maybe to a quest there, and proof this e.g. by a photo or by determining a log password on site. This type of containerless cache is called a "virtual cache".</p>
