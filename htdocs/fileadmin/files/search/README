The Firefox seach plugin has been traditionally provided at
http://cms.opencaching.de/fileadmin/files/search. This domain is now
redirected to www.opencaching.de. We try to migrate the search plugin
to http://www.opencaching.de/resource2/misc/mozilla, but as there is
an unknown number of old copues of the .src file out there, the old
path is still needed for a while. (Analyze webserver accesslog to
find out wenn it can be discarded!)
